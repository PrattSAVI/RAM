Eelgrass beds used to cover large areas in the estuary, including an estimate of 420 acres around Manhattan in the 1600s. Virtually all of these beds were lost because of water pollution, damage by boats, and fishing gear, and disease. The draft Comprehensive Restoration Plan for the estuary short- and long-term goals for eelgrass are to restore one eelgrass test bed in each of the eight planning regions and ultimately three established beds in each region capable of supporting eelgrass. The first effort toward this goal has been in Jamaica Bay, where pilot projects to determine viability using different techniques have been occurring since 2009. Although there is only anectodal information on whether eelgrass beds were previously present in Jamaica Bay, the bay has been identified as a promising site for eelgrass restoration. The most promising site identified via the pilot projects—Breezy Point—was selected for a larger planting of 8,000 plants, which were planted in October 2011. The site is currently being monitored to determine whether an eelgrass meadow could be self-sustained in that location.","Cost":"350000","Lat":40.569499999999998,"Long":-73.886600000000001,"Key_Partners":"NYCDEP","Datafrom":"Isabelle","RWG_Comments":"No Information","Photo":"N","Photo_Credit":"","CRPID":201213,"db":"Completed","SiteName":"Rockaway Inlet eelgrass restoration"}},{"type":"Feature","id":210,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.900967999999978,40.935389000000043,0]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":210,"Year_Completed":"2012","Acerage":"","State":"NY","Municipality_or_Borough":"Yonkers","Key_Funding_Source":"No Information","Contact":"No Information","Primary_TEC":"STECTributary","Narrative":"","Cost":"","Lat":40.935389000000001,"Long":-73.900968000000006,"Key_Partners":"No Information","Datafrom":"Isabelle","RWG_Comments":"No Information","Photo":"N","Photo_Credit":"","CRPID":201214,"db":"Completed","SiteName":"Sawmill River Daylighting"}},{"type":"Feature","id":211,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.900967999999978,40.935389000000043,0]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":211,"Year_Completed":"2012","Acerage":"","State":"NY","Municipality_or_Borough":"Yonkers","Key_Funding_Source":"No Information","Contact":"No Information","Primary_TEC":"STECAccess","Narrative":"Upgrade/enhancement","Cost":"","Lat":40.935389000000001,"Long":-73.900968000000006,"Key_Partners":"No Information","Datafrom":"Isabelle","RWG_Comments":"No Information","Photo":"N","Photo_Credit":"","CRPID":201215,"db":"Completed","SiteName":"Sawmill River Daylighting"}},{"type":"Feature","id":212,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.257199999999955,40.398200000000031,0]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":212,"Year_Completed":"2012","Acerage":"108","State":"NJ","Municipality_or_Borough":"Raritan Township","Key_Funding_Source":"Green Acres NJDEP","Contact":"NJDEP","Primary_TEC":"STECAcquisition","Narrative":"Aberdeen Township purchased this site known as Hauser Farm with a combination of public and private funding sources, ensuring the property will not be developed and instead will become parkland open to the public.

Approximately 375,000 cubic yards of clean sand dredged from the Ambrose Channel (part of the USACE, NY District's NY/NJ Harbor Deepening Project) was beneficially used to restore approximately 44 acres of marsh within the northern half of the Yellow Bar Hassock marsh island. Approximately 85% of the restored marsh is low marsh, with the balance restored as high marsh. Nearly 30 acres have been planted with seed collected within Jamaica Bay. The low marsh areas were seeded with smooth cordgrass while the high elevations were planted with over 100,000 2-inch plugs of saltmarsh meadow grass and spikegrass (also collected within Jamaica Bay). Before the sand was placed, the team removed approximately 11,000 hummocks from the marsh island’s low lying areas. Hummocks are mounds of terrain and vegetation above ground that are often made from decaying plants. The hummocks were stored in fenced off areas on the project site and after the sand was placed on the island they were transplanted onto the new areas of higher elevation. The NYS Department of Environmental Conservation and NYC Department of Environmental Protection contributed funds for the project, along with The Port Authority of New York & New Jersey, the non-Federal sponsor. Other project partners include the National Park Service and National Resources Conservation Service.","Cost":"19642857","Lat":40.610599999999998,"Long":-73.841899999999995,"Key_Partners":"NPS, USACE","Datafrom":"Isabelle","RWG_Comments":"Lisa provided fact sheet","Photo":"N","Photo_Credit":"","CRPID":201219,"db":"Completed","SiteName":"Yellow Bar Hassock restoration, Jamaica Bay Marsh Islands"}},{"type":"Feature","id":216,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.751907999999958,40.761881000000074,0]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":216,"Year_Completed":"2012","Acerage":"1.5","State":"NY","Municipality_or_Borough":"Queens","Key_Funding_Source":"NYCDEP","Contact":"John McLaughlin","Primary_TEC":"STECWetland","Narrative":"","Cost":"","Lat":40.761881000000002,"Long":-73.751908,"Key_Partners":"No Information","Datafrom":"Isabelle","RWG_Comments":"No Information","Photo":"N","Photo_Credit":"","CRPID":201220,"db":"Completed","SiteName":"Alley Creek wetlands restoration South"}},{"type":"Feature","id":217,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.832599999999957,40.606900000000053,0]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":217,"Year_Completed":"2013","Acerage":"30","State":"NY","Municipality_or_Borough":"Queens","Key_Funding_Source":"USACE’s Beneficial Use Program; local partners (NYCDEP, NYSDEC, The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, ALS, Jamaica Bay Ecowatchers)","Contact":"Lisa Baron","Primary_TEC":"STECWetland","Narrative":"Ambrose Channel sand was beneficially used to restore 30 acres of marsh islands at Black Wall (155,000 cubic yards of sand, 20.5 acres) and Rulers Bar (95,000 cubic yards of sand, 9.8 acres) as part of the USACE’s Beneficial Use Program with local partners (NYCDEP, NYSDEC, and The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey).
